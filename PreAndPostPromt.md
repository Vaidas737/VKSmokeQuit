PRE:
Project instructions are defined in AI_PROJECT_BRIEF.md. **Read and follow it before making any changes.**

POST:
Update only AI_PROJECT_BRIEF.md if needed to reflect the project’s current state. Make the minimum edits required; if it’s already accurate, do nothing. Do not describe or summarize any changes (no notes/changelog). Ensure the brief is useful for future AI development and includes a concise app overview, structure/architecture, and key application rules/constraints.
